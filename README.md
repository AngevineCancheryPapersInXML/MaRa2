# MaRa2
Marcatore dei Registri Angioini version2

It follows MaRa1, that was a group of scripts with a minimal web interface used to import trancripts of Angevine Canchery Papers edited in:

 **I registri della Cancelleria Angioina, Napoli, since ----**

MaRa1 was a test used for my degree, MaRa2 was its evolution and was used in production to implement a first substantial XML database.

Here all the script were rewritten or nested in a CodeIgniter based framework, the job from raw text to the xml was designed in a flow: 

from the import of the transcript to the export of a set of xml valid documents.

All the first part of the import job, previously made with a common text editor, was integrated in the framework with CodeMirror.

This repo comes with a small set of documents ready to be imported.
